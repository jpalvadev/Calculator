# Talkulator!

This Project is part of The Odin Project's Curriculum

- [Live Here](https://jpalvadev.github.io/Calculator/)

## Things I learned - getting better at

- Local Storage manage.

- Themes with Javascript.

- Speech Recognition.

- More complex CSS transitions and animations.

## Description and considerations

- Simple calculator with dark and light theme.
- I also added a simple math game, hope you enjoy it!
- This calculator has voice recognition too! It only accepts 3 parameters (operand, operator, operand), so, you can't concatenate operations.
  Tried it with Chrome and Firefox and it works fine. If you can't make it work in Firefox you have to go to about:config and switch the flags media.webspeech.recognition.enable and media.webspeech.recognition.force_enable to true.
